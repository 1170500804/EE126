    "To see why efficient coding techniques are important, consider an erasure channel in which each packet sent gets dropped with some probability $p$.  If we wanted to convey a message, we could consider a feedback channel in which the receiver tells the sender which messages were received and the sender re-sends the dropped packets.  This process can be repeated until the receiver gets all of the intended message.  While this procedure is indeed optimal in all senses of the word, feedback is simply not possible in many circumstances.  What can we do in this situation?\n",

    "The coding scheme we will work with in this lab will be a type of erasure code.  Under the binary erasure channel (BEC) model, bits that are sent through a noisy channel either make it through unmodified or are tagged as \"corrupt\", in which case the recieved information is dropped in all further information processing steps. In this lab, rather than transmitting bits, we will be transmitting packets, each of which will be dropped independently with probability $p$. \n",

    "You want to stream the new season of House of Cards from Netflix at midnight.  But so do 1 million other people!  Obviously the server loads are going to be high, so how can Netflix ensure that everyone watches without intermittent lags (which are frustrating and will lose them customers)?  Well, one way is to increase the number of servers so that the load on any one server is decreased, but this costs a lot of money.  Another important thing for them to consider is in the transmission process.  When users are downloading the movie, Netflix servers don't want to have too much overhead to figure out which users need which bits of the video to get smooth playback.  If they use near-optimal codes to encode and constantly send out the same random chunks of the video's data to all users, then they can be sure that users get what they need in only a little more than $n$ transmissions *no matter what parts of the show each individual user lost through their specific channel*!\n",

    "### Example: Encoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Before jumping into the algorithm, let's look at an example. Suppose we are trying to transmit 4 packets of equal length: $x_1, x_2, x_3, x_4$. Rather than sending the individual packets, we will first use an encoding process, where we will XOR packets together before transmitting them. These XOR'd packets are the actual packets we will transmit, and we will refer to these combined packets as $y_i$'s, where $y_i$ is the $i$-th transmitted packet. The number of packets $d$ we choose to XOR together is chosen according to a **degree distribution**. Suppose we are working with the following degree distribution: $d$ is chosen uniformly between 1, 2, and 3 (so each of 1, 2, and 3 are selected with $\\frac{1}{3}$ probability).\n",
    "\n",
    "1) We'll create our first combined packet to transmit, $y_1$. We choose a degree $d$ at random between 1, 2, and 3. Let's say we get $d=2$. Now, we choose 2 packets at random out of our 4 original packets to XOR together. Let's say we get $x_1$ and $x_3$. Therefore, our packet we have $y_1 = x_1 \\oplus x_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Now, we'll create our second packet $y_2$. This time, we get $d=1$, and when we select one random packet from our original packets, we get $x_2$, so we have $y_2 = x_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Let's say we continue this process and get the following packets: $y_3 = x_1 \\oplus x_2 \\oplus x_4$, $y_4 = x_3 \\oplus x_4$, and $y_5 = x_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can visualize this encoding process as a random bipartite graph. Consider the following image for this example. We have all of the original packets, the $x_i$'s, on the left side, and the XOR'd packets to be transmitted, the $y_i$'s, on the right side. In the graph, there is an edge between $x_i$ and $y_j$ if $x_i$ is a part of packet $y_j$.\n",

    "### Example: Decoding\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we have encoded our packets, let's walk through the decoding process. In the lab, each of our transmitted packets is dropped with probability $p$, but in this example, we'll have $p=0$ (so no packets are dropped). In addition, we'll send the packet indices that make up a packet $y_i$, so the receiver knows which packets are being combined. We'll examine the situation from the perspective of the receiver. The receiver will keep track of which original packets, the $x_i$'s, it has figured out, and it will also keep track of packets that need to be processed further. Run the following code cell to walk through the interactive simulation!"

    "### Encoding Algorithm\n",
    "1. For $n$ packets you want to transmit in total ($x_1$, $x_2$, ... $x_n$), pick $d$ according to some degree distribution such that $1\\leq d \\leq n$.\n",
    "2. With $d$ picked, now select $d$ random packets of the $n$ and combine the bits together using the XOR operator.\n",
    "3. Transmit this combined packet, along with the metadata telling which actual packet indices were XOR'd. Note that transmitting this extra information won't incur a lot of overhead if the size of metadata is relatively small compared to the rest of the packet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Decoding Algorithm\n",
    "1. Reconstruct the list of packet indices which were XOR'd (in our case, these are just explicitly sent with the data).\n",
    "2. For each source packet, check if the packet is a singleton, in which case the encoded packet is exactly equal to the actual packet.  If not, we can check if any of the packets that have been XOR'd are already known, in which case XOR that packet with the encoded packet and remove it from the list of packet indices that make up the encoded chunk.\n",
    "3. After removing the packets, if there are two or more indices in the list for the encoded packet, we cannot figure out any more information!  Put it on the side for looking at later.\n",
    "4. With any newly decoded information, we may be able to decode previously undecodable packets that we had put on the side.  Go through all unsolved packets and try to decode more packets until nothing more can be done.\n",
    "5. Wait for the next encoded packet to come and repeat!\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab, you'll implement the decoding algorithm, and you'll also experiment with the parameter $d$, the number of packets to combine together, by trying out several different degree distributions."

As in the case above when we were transmitting packets, we assume that the bins know which color indices comprise the bin, and here, we'll think of the data as the colors themselves. We begin in the left diagram, and our first step is to find bins that only contain one ball. Indeed, we see that bin 4 contains a single yellow ball, so we know that this is one of our 'active' colors. After this discovery, we can then remove all yellow balls from their respective bins, and the right diagram shows the updated colors in the bins. we see that bin 2 contains only one blue ball, and bin 3 only contains one red ball. Therefore, we've discovered two more 'active' colors, and after removing all blue and red balls, there are no more balls left in the bins, so we have successfully found all of the 'active' colors!"
